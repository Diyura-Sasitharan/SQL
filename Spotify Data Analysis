-- For this project I have downloaded data from Kaggle, loaded the data into a table and analysed the results. 

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

-- after this I inserted the Spotifydata.csv into the table through SQLite and then analysed the data

-- what are the top 10 most popular artists? 

SELECT Spotifydata.artist_name FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 10
;

-- how popular are the top 10 compared to the overall average? 

SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity, danceability,
    CASE 
        WHEN popularity > ( SELECT AVG(popularity) FROM Spotifydata ) THEN "above avg popularity"
        ELSE "below avg popularity"
    END as "popularity compared to average?"
    FROM Spotifydata
    ORDER BY popularity DESC LIMIT 10
    ;
    
-- which artist released the longest song?

SELECT artist_name, track_name, MAX(duration_ms)
FROM Spotifydata
;

-- how many songs have a loudness below -5? 

SELECT COUNT(artist_name) FROM Spotifydata
WHERE loudness < -5
;
-- find which artists have an average danceability greater than 0.85?

SELECT artist_name, AVG(danceability) FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING AVG(danceability) > 0.85
;
